This project provides Distutils commands that can be used to create PND files for the Pandora handheld (see openpandora.org and pandorawiki.org/PND ).

Two commands are provided: gen_pxml and bdist_pnd.  gen_pxml will generate a PXML file based on information contained in the setup script and provided as options.  bdist_pnd will assemble a PND file by taking advantage of the install command.  Therefore, any options given to install (or its subcommands) in the setup.cfg will be reflected in the PND.

To use these commands, install this package as normal ("python setup.py install"); the two commands can then be accessed using the command-packages option (on other projects, either use "python setup.py --command-packages=distutils", or add "command-packages=distutils" to your setup.cfg, under the "global" heading).  From there, use the --help command to learn what these commands can do.
